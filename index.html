                                Welcome to Karakol.
                        
                                Perhaps you are passing through our city, but why don't you stay in Karakol for a while?
                            
                                The city of Karakol has long been considered the gateway to the natural wonders of the Tien Shan Mountains and Lake Issyk-Kul. However, its unique location and amazing history have, over time, turned it into one of the most fascinating cultural and culinary destinations in Kyrgyzstan. Karakol is a city full of secrets that it is ready to share with you and tell its wonderful story.
                            
                                "Located on the very border of unexplored lands, Karakol became the base, the starting point for the expeditions of Nikolai Mikhailovich Przhevalsky, Vsevolod Ivanovich Roborovsky, Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov and many others. They prepared food, attracted guides, drivers, selected people for safety and tested their equipment before the distant journey."

They prepared food, attracted guides, drivers, selected people for safety and tested their equipment before the distant journey."

                        Monument to Nikolai Przhevalsky
                                            
                        In 1888, on the eve of his fifth expedition, Przhevalsky contracted typhus on the Chu River and died near Karakol. He was buried on the banks of Issyk-Kul. The tsar renamed Karakol Przhevalsk to honor the memory of the explorer, however, in 1991 the original name returned to the city.
                                            
                        The memorial museum of Nikolai Mikhailovich Przhevalsky was opened in Karakol in 1957, including documents and exhibits from the archives of the Geographical Society of the USSR. Today, the museum's exposition includes documents, photographs and personal belongings of Przewalski. Nearby is his grave and a monument. The only problem of the museum for foreign tourists may be the fact that all descriptions of exhibits in the museum are given only in Russian.
